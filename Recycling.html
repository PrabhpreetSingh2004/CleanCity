  <!-- Why Recycling is Important -->
  <section class="recycling-benefits">
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Why Recycling is Important</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">Recycling is a crucial practice in today‚Äôs world as it directly contributes to protecting our planet. By recycling, we reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and oceans, which helps minimize pollution and keeps our environment clean. It also conserves precious natural resources like water, trees, minerals, and fossil fuels by giving new life to old materials. Instead of continuously extracting raw materials, recycling allows us to reuse what's already been taken, making it a sustainable and eco-friendly choice. It also significantly reduces the energy required to produce new products, which means fewer carbon emissions and a smaller carbon footprint. In a world facing climate change and resource depletion, recycling is not just a choice‚Äîit‚Äôs a responsibility.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Benefits of Recycling</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">Recycling offers a wide range of benefits. Environmentally, it reduces pollution, saves energy, and preserves natural ecosystems. Economically, it creates jobs in the recycling, sorting, and manufacturing industries, contributing to local economies. Recycling also promotes a cleaner and healthier community by decreasing the waste sent to landfills, which are often sources of harmful gases and toxins. Most importantly, it fosters a culture of responsibility and awareness. When people recycle, they become more conscious of their consumption habits and the impact they have on the planet. Together, these benefits make recycling a powerful tool for creating a greener, cleaner, and more sustainable future for all.</p>
